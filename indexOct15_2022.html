			<strong>I  apply compassion, business acumen, and prose to conceive a better present &amp; more interesting future.</strong>

		<p>
			My name is Josh, and my email is <b>josh@joshpetersel.com</b>. Here's a few things that are important to me:
		</p>
		<h2 id=''><br>Writing</h2>
			<p>I write essays into <i>Google Docs</i>. I'm inspired by: <br>
				<ol>
					<li><b>My Village</b>: What do the people I care about, care about?</li>
					<li><b>Technology</b>: Where is technology trending? What's counterintuitive (or, often, absurd) about that; what should we do about it?</li>
					<li><b>Purpose</b>: How does a modern young adult, with more options &amp; fewer encumbrances than ever, create and derive meaning for themselves?</li>
					
				</ol>
				My metric is dialogue, not clicks or views. I've shipped (roughly) monthly for over a decade, and consistently every 1,000 words I write turns into over 3,000 words in comments, replies, and new ideas from a few dozen loyal readers. So entries are really more than essays; they're kindling for conversation.<br><br>

				If that sounds cool, maybe we’ll get along. Hi! <br><br>

				I designed &amp; coded this webpage because I think basic tech familiarity is important (hey, see #2 above!) and because it was fun. I operate out of <i>Google Docs</i> instead of, say, Substack &amp; Discord, for Docs' unrivaled feature set: it's intuitive for most any computer user to navigate, it offers some discretion &amp; obfuscation from search engines to engender a sense of intimacy, there's nice Gmail integrations, and you probably don't need to create some new login for credentials.
			</p>

		<h2 id='Etc'><br>Coaching</h2>
			<p>One way I pay it forward is by occasionally performing careers services (Resume, Search, and Interview prep) for young people who aspire to work in tech. If you’re hunting for your first tech job, my coaching is pro-bono. <br><br>
			
			I've helped folks land roles they love (Product Managers, Business Analysts, etc.) at growth startups to FAANG companies. My essay <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hVVFXpEom4SqAKpaskasct6qR7dWwlRz6kqWX0JRrA/edit>Getting a job at a Blockbuster</a> consolidates my industry observations and my most common pragmatic tactics. Email me to find time for 1:1 perspective on your unique situation.
			</p>

		<h2 id='Things'><br>About</h2>
		<p>
			Personally: I live in Toronto; I'm a Brooklyn &amp; St Louis expat. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNx0V_wczJ3s19I3GRDIllGKftEKRrTMjjAeP2pbAyE/edit'>I listen to albums, slowly</a>. I mentor with Big Brothers / Big Sisters. My favorite sport is surfing; my favorite game is Berlin-style ping-pong.<br><br>

			Professionally: I'm a Director at Spotify, where I build revenue systems and lead a team with the North Star mission of making music accessible &amp; sustainable. I'm a fierce customer advocate. I'm a Harvard MBA, but don't identify with the mental image many seem to carry of that school's alums. <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nopc7-IOMhMV5LUesF864xuw9eN3uJ9hw2JKAvQFQJM/edit'>I measure</a>, and often rely on data to make decisions, but also know when it's time to trust my experience &amp; instincts.

		<h2 id='Signature'><br>Get in touch</h2>
			<p><strong>Write me at josh@joshpetersel.com</strong>. I think anyone earnest who asks for 20 minutes of help should get it &mdash; if you made it this far and that's you, or even if you're not quite sure... well, no harm now in dropping me a line. <br><br>
